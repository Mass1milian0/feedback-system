# feedback-system
 a feedback system based on donuts charts and visible checkboxes

this allows the user from a server to set some checkboxes and stats to then be visible to another user as readonly data used as feedback

very WIP, about halfway done... maybe

# how to run

1. install node.
2. on a command prompt located at the project folder run: node server.js.

on your explorer go to localhost:8080/server to be able to edit things and localhost:8080/client to view data as readonly
(you can set env variables for the server port and websocket port)

* PORT , socketPort
* LISTENERPORT , webserver port

very wip expect bugs and no security at all
